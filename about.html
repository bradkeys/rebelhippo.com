<p>
    We are a small indie game development studio based in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada.
    Our goal is to create fun games with great replay value that you can experience with friends.
    Our passion for multiplayer and roguelike games is unmatched.
    We strive to improve, innovate, and evolve the genres we develop.
</p>

<p>
    You can often find us at local game jams, as well as <a href="http://unity3d.com">Unity</a> meetups and events.
    If we're not there, it's likely because we are caught up in an intense game of <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/41114/resistance">The Resistance</a> and someone needs to come tell us to stop.

<h2>History</h2>

<p>
    Rebel Hippo was founded in 2011 by <a href="http://www.bradkeys.com">Brad Keys</a> and <a href="http://www.matthewminer.com">Matthew Miner</a> after <a href="http://velocity.uwaterloo.ca/2011/12/demo-day-winners-lumos-inflo/">winning</a> the first <a href="http://velocity.uwaterloo.ca/funding/velocity-fund/">Velocity Venture Fund</a> competition from the University of Waterloo with their pitch for Lumos game analytics.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.lumospowered.com">Lumos</a> was primarily worked on part-time as a hobby.
    During development thousands of games registered on Lumos, leading the company to land an investment in 2013 allowing the founders to work full-time with Rebel Hippo.
    The service was completely overhauled and offered additional features such as leaderboards, achievements, user profiles, and remote error logging.
</p>
<p>
    In 2014 the studio expanded development to include mobile games and contract game development services.
    They helped develop <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.daybreak.Pool">Kings of Pool</a> and created their first in-house game, the action-packed <a href="http://playorbert.com">Orbert</a>.
</p>
<p>
    In 2015 the studio began designing <a href="/products/Just_Pretend/">Just Pretend</a>, a roguelike action adventure game for consoles and PC/Mac.
    A prototype is currently being developed for a Kickstarter campaign in 2016.
